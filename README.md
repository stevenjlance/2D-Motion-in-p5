# Motion in p5

Today we are going to learn how to create animations in p5.js! Up to this point, besides when we using `random()`, we haven't been able to create motion on our screen. Today we are going to fix that!

## Tasks
1. **CHALLENGE 1**: Create 3 shapes and have them move from left to right across the screen. The shapes should have ***different*** speeds.
